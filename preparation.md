# Workshop preparation 

Preparation for this tutorial consists of two steps: [Getting the code](#get-the-code) and [getting the software](#get-the-software). Follow the steps below. 

## Get the code

This workshop uses one piece of code: [Workshop-File-ggplot2.R](https://github.com/scds/ggplot2/blob/1d7f5c890106b9e3457f15736569a39b6f30cdea/assets/data/workshop-file-ggplot2.R)

## Get the software
This hands-on workshop uses [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/), a software application for data analysis. We ask that you download R in advance of the workshop to be able to participate in it to the fullest extent.

You can download R for free on the [official R website](https://www.r-project.org/).
